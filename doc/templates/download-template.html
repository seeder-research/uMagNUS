<h2> Prerequisites </h2>

To run uMagNUS you need

<ul>
    <li> A GPU supporting OpenCL 1.2</li>
    <li> Drivers for your GPU to support OpenCL 1.2</li>
    <li> Optional: <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a> for plots in the web GUI</li>
</ul>

<h2> Download and installation </h2>

<p>
You may download pre-compiled binaries from the "Releases" page of the <a href="http://github.com/seeder-research/uMagNUS">uMagNUS repository</a>.
After downloading and unpacking the archive, you will have a uMagNUS executable which is ready to be used. 
Note that uMagNUS is a command line application, so it is a good idea to add the directory containing 
the uMagNUS executable to the PATH environment variable.
